# How to contribute to docker2oci

Please take note of the projects design goals:

* Follow the Unix philosophy as close as possible, i.e.:
  * Re-use existing, well-established tooling,
  * Stay true to the design goal (simple dockerhub2oci converter).
* Implement the functionality in a simple shell script, i.e. call external tools,
  but don't invoke extra scripting languages (python / perl). 

Also, please mind the pull request template, which states:
```
I agree that my changes can be licensed under Apache License 2.0.
```
Please keep this line in for your first contribution.
